About Me 

I'm a Frontend Software Engineer with a drive for crafting user-centered, high-performance applications. My expertise lies in developing responsive interfaces and optimizing code for smooth and accessible user experiences. Leveraging my skills in React.js, Redux, Zustand, and cloud technologies like AWS, I approach every project with a blend of technical rigor and creativity.

My Journey

Holding a Master's in Computer Science from Clemson University, I've cultivated a deep understanding of cloud computing, database management systems, security, and applied data science. My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous coursework and practical projects, preparing me to tackle real-world challenges with agility and insight.

In my professional voyage with US Army Corps and Zensar Technologies, I've had the privilege of enhancing web functionalities using React.js, integrating robust backends with Java and Node.js, and developing scalable RESTful APIs. My work on www.michaelkors.com stands out as a testament to my ability to boost site performance and user engagement through thoughtful integration and optimization.

Looking Ahead 🔍

As I continue to explore the vast landscape of cloud engineering, my goal is to contribute to projects that not only leverage my technical expertise but also push me to learn and grow. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of Kubernetes in optimizing cloud-native workloads and am eager to dive deeper into performance tuning and hardware security integration.
